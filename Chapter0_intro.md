# Coding a 2D Game Engine in Java

## What is going on
This book will be using lwjgl for programming the graphics. 

This will use opengl and GLFW for window handling


### Rendering
1. Shaders
2. Meeshes
3. Batching

### Finite State Automata
    State machines for animations and animation state triggers. 
Key frames will be used for timing out animation changes

### Physics
1. Static/Dynamic Phics
2. Collision Detection
3. Collision Resolution

This will be a tile based physics for the static objects, and box detection
for dynamic components

### User Interface
1. Window Management
2. Fully Featured Level Editor

### Packaging and Distribution

### Putting it all together: Mario
Creating a game using the engine we built
